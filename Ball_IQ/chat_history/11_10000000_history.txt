Bot: Hey! Alright, let's get you the best players for your team based on the expected points for the next game. Since you didn't specify a tactic, I'll go with the classic 4-4-2 formation. Here’s what I recommend:

For goalkeeper, I’d go with David Raya from Arsenal, expected points: 2.7.

In defense, the top pick is Alex Moreno from Nottingham Forest, expected points: 3.2. Then, I’d suggest Gabriel Magalhaes from Arsenal, expected points: 2.7, Saliba from Arsenal, expected points: 2.3, and Ben White from Arsenal, expected points: 1.5.

In midfield, Salah from Liverpool is your star player, expected points: 12.5. Next, I’d recommend Emile Smith Rowe from Fulham, expected points: 6.3, and Martinelli from Arsenal, expected points: 5.0. Lastly, Saka from Arsenal, expected points: 4.0.

For forwards, I’d suggest Kai Havertz from Arsenal, expected points: 2.3, and Gabriel Jesus from Arsenal, expected points: 1.7.

So, to sum it up, here’s your lineup:
- GK: David Raya (Arsenal) - 2.7
- DEF: Alex Moreno (Nottingham Forest) - 3.2
- DEF: Gabriel Magalhaes (Arsenal) - 2.7
- DEF: Saliba (Arsenal) - 2.3
- DEF: Ben White (Arsenal) - 1.5
- MID: Salah (Liverpool) - 12.5
- MID: Emile Smith Rowe (Fulham) - 6.3
- MID: Martinelli (Arsenal) - 5.0
- MID: Saka (Arsenal) - 4.0
- FWD: Kai Havertz (Arsenal) - 2.3
- FWD: Gabriel Jesus (Arsenal) - 1.7

This lineup should give you a solid chance to rack up some points! Let me know if you need anything else!
