- Gabriel dos Santos Magalhães (Arsenal) - 4.0 expected points

User: Tell me what is a goal
Bot: A goal is awarded to a player if they shoot on target and the ball ends up in the opposition's goal, regardless of any deflections. If the shot is not on target and still ends in the goal, it is considered an own goal by the opposing player who deflected it.
User: Tell me what is a goal and an assist and yellow card
Bot: A goal is awarded to a player if they shoot on target and the ball ends up in the opposition's goal, regardless of deflections. An assist is given to the player who last touches the ball before a teammate scores, unless the final touch is significantly altered by an opposing player or results from an unforced defensive error. A yellow card leads to a points deduction in fantasy football, and if a player receives two yellow cards, they are penalized as if they received a red card.

Bot: Hey! I got you covered. Based on your current team, I’ll suggest a solid lineup using the 4-4-2 formation, which will give you a good balance. Here are the best players you can consider:

**Defenders:**
1. William Saliba (Arsenal) - Expected Points: 7.3
2. Gabriel dos Santos Magalhães (Arsenal) - Expected Points: 4.0
